## Week_7 : 
### You are Arturo who constantly gets yourself in trouble due to your attempts to defy the robbers and stage uprisings within the Royal Mint. After the heist, you became something of a celebrity, giving talks about your experience. When the crew returned to Spain to rob the Bank of Spain, you approached the building and ran inside when the entrance doors were about to close, becoming a hostage again. You tried to manipulate other hostages to go against the robbers This time you were planning a fake countdown timer to scare the hostages and divert their mind so that you can find a way to escape. Write a python program to make a countdown timer where you will set the timer and when the countdown is over it will prompt a message saying “You were Deceived.!!”.

## Week_8 :

### You are Denver, one of the robbers participating in the Royal Mint of Spain heist. You are hot-headed but you also have a sensitive side when you choose to protect hostage Mónica Gaztambide instead of disposing of her as instructed by Berlin. In part 2 your father gets injured so you start digging the tunnel but suddenly remember that your father has plotted some shock treatment for the gang who come to attack your team as a backup so you need to walk carefully while getting inside the tunnel. The empty places where you can walk are of geometric shape. Write a python program to detect the geometrically shaped objects using python libraries.

### Note: The shapes are either rectangular, circle, or triangle. 

### Steps to be followed;

### 1.Detect the objects from the webcam, removing the background.
### 2.Find the contours of the objects detected.
### 3.Detect the shape of each of the objects detected, in real-time.
